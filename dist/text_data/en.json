Then I sat up at night in front of the monitor screen and stared at the strange and incomprehensible (for many people) HTML tags. Of course I do not have to mention that it turned out to be my passion. Thanks to this passion, later I graduated from computer science and I still love coding in languages used for web development.<p>",
